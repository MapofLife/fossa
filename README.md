Wikipedia:
The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) is a cat-like, carnivorous mammal that is endemic to Madagascar ... It is the largest mammalian carnivore on the island of Madagascar and has been compared to a small cougar ... Over 50% of its diet consists of lemurs.

We are using Fossa to chew through GBIF species occurrence data, which may include lemurs, with the help of Clojure, Cascalog and Hadoop.
